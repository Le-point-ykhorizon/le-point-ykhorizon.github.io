# What allowed us to survive?

- Strong technical team - not intimidated by any technical challenge
- High ego for the product
- Low burn (minimum cost of running solution)

# What problem are you solving?

- Can you state the problem clearly? (in two sentence)
- Have you experienced it yourself?
- Can you define this problem narrowly?
  - Let's talk about the people that we can address first? who can we help first? immediately? How can we get first indication that this this working? what is that use case?
- Is that problem solvable?
  - Babysitter example

# Who is your customer?

- Everyone?(No!)
- First customer
- __How offen__ do they have the problem?
  - frequency of the problem. example: car shopping website 
  - Who is getting the most value out of this product?
  - You're trying to help someone with the problem they have frequently
  - if you think about the products that you use on a daily basis
- How __intense__ is the problem?
  - __Frequency and intensity__ analysis. example: uber (buy a car, taxi)
- Are they willing to pay?
  - Give it a way for free = > No
  - You want to know wheather you have a good prouct? 
    - it's a lot easier to make it a litte bit harder (pay) for your user to use it 
    - and then see if it they use it anyways
    - Charge zero dollar to the user come only to try something out, not intense problem
    
      - Try to learn from the wrong person
    - Start with a higher price or a price is almost / always better
    - If you need to give it free, you need to do the analysis of how do you talk yhe user 
      - where the problem is actually intense
      - use product frequently, in production, for real-world purpose
      - talk to the good customer is good but talk to the bad customer is very very bad => hijack
- How easy are they to find?
  - Get water to the pepole in the middle of a desert in the Sahara
